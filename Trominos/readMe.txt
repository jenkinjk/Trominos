So I had to rush this a little bit due to not having internet for the next two weeks, however everything does work. 
There are some major efficiency issues, and a few minor glitches I would like to iron out if I had more time. Most notably is that
the way it displays ends up evenly dividing the available 1000 spaces and rounding DOWN (hence why the display shrinks the larger N is). So if 
you have more than 1000 spots to cover the algorithm works correctly... But shows nothing.
Also, it is very hard to see where the individual trominos are being placed, particularly in the homework algorithms. However, I do not have
time to fix this. The algorithm fills it in correctly and the recursive steps can be found in backEnd.Problems67 updateSquares(). This is a
major glitch I would really like to fix, but unfortunately simply do not have time to.
